# Step 3: Implementing Value Iteration
## Task: Students implement the Value Iteration algorithm
to solve the FrozenLake-v1 environment.
## Deliverable:
- Python code for the Value Iteration algorithm.
- A plot showing the convergence of the state value
function.
- A discussion on how the policy derived from Value
Iteration performs in the environment.
