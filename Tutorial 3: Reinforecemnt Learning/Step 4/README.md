# Step 4: Implementing Q-Learning

## Task: 
Implement the Q-learning algorithm and test it in
the same FrozenLake-v1 environment.
## Deliverable:
- Python code for the Q-learning algorithm.
- Plots showing the learning curve (rewards over episodes).
- An evaluation comparing the performance of the
learned policy against the policy from Value Iteration.
